        <h2>Our Love Story</h2>
        <p>Honestly, I believe it was fate and it was meant to happen. No way such love can be found by accident. You make every day so fun and exciting,  just thinking that I have such an incredible wife automatically 
          makes me so happy and whenever I'm going through some rough stuff throughout my day, I picture that beautiful face of yours with those shiny eyes and smile.  I thank god that on 28/06/2023 I logged on to club penguin, and also not knowing how to put those headphones on the damn puffle. I asked everyone(including you) and they ignored me, but I forgive you. After some time passed and I gave up on that task, I saw that your penguin and I immediately thought...Why not?
        </p>
        <p>So I went up to you:<br>  <div class="blueText">chknuggt: Coffee?</div><br> <div class="pinkText">onsnopitzari: Sure</div> </p><p>And that kids, is how I met your mother... </p>
        <p>After that day, true love was proven to exist. What are the odds, that one island boy and one island girl meet like that? I liked you because you seemed so intelligent and funny. I never had such a good time talking to someone. I felt a connection immediately and I wanted to stay in touch with you, and that's where chess.com helped. Unfortunately, you had to go to balled and you left. That didn't stop me from thinking about how to send you a message. I was thinking so hard about how not to fuck this up, and I said to myself I will send you a message right after I finish uni. Turned out you sent me a message first and I wish to this day you could see my expressions. So I texted back and one thing led to another and we were talking all day. I can confidently say that my smile didn't disappear for not even a second. As I'm writing this I'm smiling and I can't stop thinking about you. 

          After you visited me in Bulgaria...Oh boy did see the most attractive woman in the whole existence. Baby what I'll say now I mean it from the bottom of my heart: </p>
        <p> In the story of my life, the best chapters are filled with you, and every time I see you, I fall in love all over again. You have become my today and all of my tomorrows, the one whom my soul loves. Loving you is not just a choice, it's my necessity, as essential to me as breathing and as vital as the warmth of the sun.
          With you, I am home. You are my heart, my life, my one and only thought. Your love shines in my heart as the sun shines upon the earth, and each day I love you more. Today, more than yesterday, and I know tomorrow will bring even greater love.
          Your love is all I need to feel complete. To the world, you may be one person, but to me, you are the world. I have loved you in infinite forms, infinite times, and I will love you forever. Being deeply loved by you gives me strength while loving you deeply gives me courage.
          You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest, and most beautiful person I have ever known. I choose you. And I'll choose you, over and over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat, I'll keep choosing you.
          I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect, and I loved you even more. I do remember the first moment I saw you walking towards me in the airport, and I realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you.
          If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, I could walk through my garden forever. I love, I love, I love you. I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.</p>
